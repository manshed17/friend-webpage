            There is no load shedding. Also known as City of lights, the most energized city with lots of opportunities.
           The city has more than 800 languages spoken, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.
           I would like to see the New Yorkk Manhattan skyline and go to the Grand Central Terminal which has a Whispering Gallery.
           If one person stands in one corner of the tiled wall and another stands on the opposite side, you can whisper each other and the other person will hear!
           I would also like to experience the Times Square.

            The place is also known as the palace of dreams. It is situated next to OR Tambo International airport.
            A place where where one can rest their heads. It offers a decadent accommodation in four unique hotels,
            a glorious health and beauty spa, a magnificent casino with unparalleled gaming enjoyment,
            the finest dining options (Rosettas being my favourite and highly recomment it), spectacular entertainment choices,
            world class conference facilities, and impeccable service.
